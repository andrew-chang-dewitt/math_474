## Course Description

Elementary probability theory including discrete and continuous distributions, sampling, estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and linear regression

### Objectives:

- Students will learn basic rules of probability, basic counting techniques, and be able to compute and interpret means and variances.
- Students will learn discrete random variables such as the binomial, the geometric, the negative binomial, the hypergeometric and the Poisson.
- Students will explore continuous random variables such as the uniform, the gamma (which includes the exponential and the chi-square) and the normal. Applications such as the normal approximation via the central limit theorem to the binomial will be discussed.
- Students will learn point and interval estimation for various parameters. The parameters will include the population mean and variance and the binomial probability of a success. After exploring the one sample situation the two sample case will also be covered. Also prediction intervals, for future observations, will be explored.
- Students will explore hypothesis testing of various parameters for both one sample and two. The parameters are those included in our confidence interval estimation.

### Textbook

In Spring 2026, we will be using a new book - ZyBook.

1. Click any zyBooks assignment link in your learning management system. (Do not go to the zyBooks website and create a new account!)
2. Subscribe.

A subscription is $69. Students may begin subscribing on Dec 29, 2025 and the cutoff to subscribe is Apr 23, 2026. Subscriptions will last until May 22, 2026. You can download the book, but you'll be expected to complete online reading assignments for course credit!

### Lecture outlines:

Caution:

These outlines are provided to help students focus on the lectures without feeling the need to write everything down. However, they are not a substitute for attending lectures.

The outlines do not capture everything covered in class. Many additional important points are discussed orally or presented in writing during the lectures.

In the past, students who relied too heavily on the outlines without attending class regularly have expressed regret. I strongly encourage you to use these outlines as a supplement, not a replacement, for active participation in lectures.

### Homework

Homework will be assigned weekly, except during break week or midterm week. Completed homework must be scanned and submitted online on Canvas by the posted deadline, which is typically Wednesday at 8:59pm, in one single PDF file. Homework may be submitted up to 3 hours late without penalty. This "grace period" is intended for resolving unexpected technical difficulty. No late homework beyond the grace period will be accepted.

Technical difficulty with Canvas is no excuse for submission beyond the grace period. If you encounter a problem with Canvas, you can also submit it directly by email to lyeung2@illinoistech.edu before the end of the grace period. You are strongly advised to submit your work well in advance of the deadline, and not wait until the end of the grace period to start submitting. Canvas allows you to replace your old submission (before the deadline), so you can always submit a newer version before the deadline.

It is your responsibility to ensure that your work is successfully submitted on time. In particular, you should check to make sure the upload was successful, that the files you upload are not corrupted, and that your work is legible.

You are encouraged to discuss with each other when solving homework problems. However, you must write up your solutions individually, and you must fully understand any solution that you submit.

Unless explicitly stated in the question, you may use a scientific calculator, Excel, Python, R or other similar programming language for homework. No AI-assisted tools are allowed. If I suspect a violation, I will call on the student to explain their solutions to me outside class.

### Participation

There will be weekly participation credit, earned by completing the reading assignment on ZyBook or by completing an activity described in class.

### Exams

There will be a midterm exam and a final exam. Midterm exam will take place in class. The final exam will be cumulative, with 2/3 of the topics from after the midterm, and 1/3 before the midterm! No calculators or electronic devices will be allowed.

### Grading

The grading scale will be no more strict than A:90-100, B:78-89, C: 65-77, D:53-64.

- Homework: 25%
- Participation & worksheets: 15%
- Midterm & final exam: 30% each

#### Missed Exam Policy

Unexcused absence from an exam will result in a score of zero. If a student misses an exam with a legitimate reason (e.g. sickness), it will be at the instructor's discretion to administer a make-up exam, which may be written and/or oral. In such cases, the student MUST notify the instructor as early as possible, certainly before the exam. Supporting documentation (e.g. doctor's note) MUST be provided. No student will be allowed to take the exam early.

#### Attendance

Regular attendance and active class participation is a crucial factor in your success in this course. Attending class allows you to actively engage with the material, participate in discussions, and collaborate with your peers. Historically, there has been a strong

correlation between attendance and overall course performance. Attendance will be recorded at the beginning of each class. While it is not a formal component of the final grade, attendance and class participation will be considered for students whose final grades are at the borderline.

## Academic Honesty

All students are expected to follow the academic honesty standards outlined here.
There will be zero tolerance for academic integrity violations, and any violation will result in an automatic E. Examples of academic integrity violations include (but are not limited to):

- Not writing up solutions independently and/or plagiarizing solutions.
- Using AI to do homework.
- Turning in solutions you do not understand
- Receiving assistance from another person during an exam
- Providing assistance to another person taking an exam.
- Discussing the exam with anyone while an exam is ongoing.

## ADA Statement

Reasonable accommodation will be made for students with documented disabilities. To receive accommodation, students work with the Center for Disability Resources to obtain services and a letter of accommodation. Contact CDR at https://web.iit.edu/cdr, 312.567.5744 or disabilities@iit.edu.

## Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information:

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment/misconduct to speak with someone about what happened, so they can get the support they need and the school can respond appropriately. If you wish to speak confidentially about an incident you believe falls under sexual harassment/ misconduct, please contact the school’s Confidential Advisor service at (773) 907-1062.
