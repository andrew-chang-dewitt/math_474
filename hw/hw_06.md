## problem 1

> (Applying the concepts of a random variable and its mean.)
>
> The Acme Shipping Company has learned from experience that it costs
> $14.80 to deliver a small package overnight. The company charges $20
> for such a shipment, but guarantees that they will refund the $20
> charge if it does not arrive within 24 hours.

### part (a)

> Let `X` be a discrete random variable representing the outcomes for
> the Acme Shipping Company. What are the possible values for `X`?

### part (b)

> Suppose Acme successfully delivers 96% of its packages within 24
> hours. What are the probabilities that correspond to the values for
> `X` you found in the previous question?

### part (c)

> Using the information from the previous two questions, what is the
> expected gain or loss for delivering a package?

## problem 2

> Solve exercise 2.106 in the textbook:
>
> The probabilities that a service station will pump gas into `0`, `1`,
> `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5` or more cars during a certain 30-minute period
> are `0.03`, `0.18`, `0.24`, `0.28`, `0.10`, and `0.17`, respectively.
>
> Find the probability that in this 30-minute period:
>
> more than 2 cars receive gas; at most 4 cars receive gas; 4 or more
> cars receive gas.

## problem 3

> Solve exercise 2.108 in the textbook:
>
> If the probability is `0.1` that a person will make a mistake on his
> or her state income tax return, find the probability that
>
> four totally unrelated persons each make a mistake; Mr. Jones and Ms.
> Clark both make mistakes, and Mr. Roberts and Ms. Williams do not
> make a mistake.

## problem 4

> Suppose that you work for an insurance company and you sell a
> $100,000 fire insurance policy at an annual premium of $1,350.
> Experience has shown that:
>
> The probability of total loss (due to fire) to a house in that area
> and of the size of your customer’s house is `0.002` (in which case
> the insurance company will pay the full $100,000 to the customer).
>
> The probability of 50% damage (due to fire) to a house in that area
> and of the size of your customer’s house is `0.008` (in which case
> the insurance company will pay only $50,000 to the customer).
>
> For simplicity, we’ll ignore any other partial losses.
>
> Let the random variable `X` be the insurance company’s annual gain
> from such a policy (i.e., the amount of money made by the insurance
> company from such a policy).
>
> Find the probability distribution of `X`. In other words, list the
> possible values that `X` can have, and their corresponding
> probabilities. (Hint: There are three possibilities here: no fire,
> total loss due to fire, 50% damage due to fire).
>
> What is the mean (expected) annual gain for a policy of this type? In
> other words, what is the mean of `X`?
>
> The insurance company gets information about gas leakage in several
> houses that use the same gas provider that your customer does. In
> light of this new information, the probabilities of total loss and
> 50% damage (that were originally `0.002` and `0.008`, respectively)
> are tripled (to `0.006` for total loss and `0.024` for 50% damage).
> Obviously, this change in the probabilities should be reflected in
> the annual premium, to account for the added risk that the insurance
> company is taking. What should be the new annual premium (instead of
> $1,350), if the company wants to keep its expected gain of $750?
> Guidance: Let the new premium (instead of 1,350) be denoted by `N`,
> for new. Set up the new probability distribution of `X` using the
> updated probabilities, and using `N` instead of 1,350. (The answer to
> question 1 will help.) The question now is: What should the value of
> `N` (the new premium) be, if we want the mean of `X` to remain `750`?
> Set up an equation with `N` as unknown, and solve for `N`.
