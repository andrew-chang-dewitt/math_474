Please write down the time you spent on this homework on the top

## Problem 1

:::{.question}

> (Exercise 2.1.17). Four bits are transmitted over a digital
> communications channel. Each bit is either distorted or received
> without distortion. Let $A_i$ denote the event that the ith bit is
> distorted, $i = 1,...,4$.

:::

### part (a)

:::{.question}

> Describe the sample space for this experiment in two ways, first as a set, and second as a tree diagram.

:::

as a set, using set builder notation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

as a tree diagram:

```no-linenums

```

### part (b)

:::{.question}

> Are the events $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, $A_4$ mutually exclusive?

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (c)

:::{.question}

> Describe the outcomes in the event $A_1$.

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (d)

:::{.question}

> Describe the outcomes in the event $A′_1$.

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (e)

:::{.question}

> Describe the outcomes in the event $A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4$.

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (f)

:::{.question}

> Describe the outcomes in the event $(A′_1 ∩ A_2) ∪ (A_3 ∩ A_4)$.

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Problem 2

:::{.question}

> (Exercise 2.1.14 modified). In an injection-molding operation, the
> length $X$ and width $Y$ (in centimeters) of each molded part are
> measured. A part is said to meet the length specification
> if $48 < X < 52$, and to meet the width specification
> if $9 < Y < 11$. Define the events
>
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
> A &=\{48<X <52\}, \\
> B &=\{9<Y <11\}.
> \end{aligned}
> $$
>
> In a quality audit, 200 parts are inspected. Among them, 170 meet the
> length specification, 150 meet the width specification, and 140 meet
> both specifications.

:::

### part (a)

:::{.question}

> Describe a reasonable sample space for the outcome of $(X, Y)$.

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (b)

:::{.question}

> Using the information above, complete the following table of counts:

:::

| B     | B′  | Total |
| ----- | --- | ----- |
| A     |     |       |
| A′    |     |       |
| Total |     | 200   |

### part (c)

:::{.question}

> Convert your table in part (b) into a table of probabilities. Using
> this table, compute $P(A), P(B), P(A∩B), P(A′∩B′), P(A∪B)$

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (d)

:::{.question}

> Use the formula for the probability of a union to compute $P(A ∪ B)$

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (e)

:::{.question}

> Draw a Venn diagram with events $A$ and $B$. Shade the regions corresponding to each of the following events: $A∪B$, $A∩B$, $A∩B′$, $(A∪B)′$.

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Problem 3

:::{.question}

> (Exercise 2.2.7). A batch of 140 semiconductor chips is inspected by choosing a sample of 5 chips without replacement. Assume 10 of the chips do not conform to customer requirements.

:::

### part (a)

:::{.question}

> How many different samples are possible?

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (a)

:::{.question}

> How many three-digit phone prefixes that are used to represent a particular geographic area (such as an area code) can be created from the digits 0 through 9?

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (b)

:::{.question}

> As in part (a), how many three-digit phone prefixes are possible that do not start with 0 or 1, but contain 0 or 1 as the middle digit?

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (c)

:::{.question}

> How many three-digit phone prefixes are possible in which no digit appears more than once in each prefix?

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

> (Exercise 2.3.17 and 2.4.9). A computer system uses passwords that
> con tain exactly eight characters, and each character is one of 26
> lowercase letters (a–z), 26 uppercase letters (A–Z), or 10 integers
> (0–9). Let $Ω$ denote the set of all possible passwords, and let $A$
> and $B$ denote the events that consist of passwords with only letters
> or only integers, respectively. Suppose that all passwords in $Ω$ are
> equally likely. Determine the probability of each of the following:
