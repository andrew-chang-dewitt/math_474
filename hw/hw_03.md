## Problem 1

:::{.question}

> communications channel. Each bit is either distorted or received
> without distortion. Let $A_i$ denote the event that the $i^\text{th}$ bit is
> distorted, $i = 1,...,4$.

### part (a)

:::{.question}

> Describe the sample space for this experiment in two ways, first as a set, and second as a tree diagram.

:::

as a set:

$$
\begin{aligned}
d &\coloneqq \text{distorted bit} \\
n &\coloneqq \text{not distorted bit} \\
S &= \begin{aligned}
       \{
        & dddd, dddn, ddnd, dndd, nddd, ddnn, nndd, dnnd, \\
        & nddn, ndnd, dndn, nnnd, nndn, ndnn, dnnn, nnnn
       \}
     \end{aligned} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

as a tree diagram:

   dddd dddn ddnd ddnn dndd dndn dnnd dnnn nddd nddn ndnd ndnn nndd nndn nnnd nnnn
```

### part (b)

:::{.question}

> Are the events $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, $A_4$ mutually exclusive?

:::

no, for example consider $A_1$ & $A_2$:

$$
\begin{align}
A_1 &= \{ dddd, dddn, ddnd, dndd, ddnn, dnnd, dndn, dnnn \} && \\
A_2 &= \{ dddd, dddn, ddnd, nddd, ddnn, nddn, ndnd, ndnn \} && \\
\end{align}
$$

as we can see these two are _**not**_ mutually exclusive,

$$
\begin{alignedat}{2}
\neg \text{MutuallyExclusive}(A_1, A_2)
     &\iff A_1 ∩ A_2 &\neq \empty \\
     &\iff \{ dddd, dddn, ddnd, ddnn \} &\neq \empty \\
     &\iff T \space_\blacksquare
\end{alignedat}
$$

thus $A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4 \neq \empty$, meaning
that $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, $A_4$ are not mutually exclusive as well.

### part (c)

:::{.question}

> Describe the outcomes in the event $A_1$.

:::

For all events in $A_1$, the first bit is distorted & the other three could be either distorted or not distorted.

### part (d)

:::{.question}

> Describe the outcomes in the event $A′_1$.

:::

For all events in $A'_1$, the first bit is _**not**_ distorted & the other three bits could be either distorted or not distorted.

### part (e)

:::{.question}

> Describe the outcomes in the event $A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4$.

:::

Because events $A_i$ are the outcomes such that the $i_\text{ith}$ bit is distorted (`d`), $A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4$ is the event that each bit is distorted, e.g.:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4 &= \{ (b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) \in S \mid b_i = d \; \forall i \in (1,2,3,4) \} \\
                               &= \{ dddd \} \space_\blacksquare
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (f)

:::{.question}

> Describe the outcomes in the event $(A′_1 ∩ A_2) ∪ (A_3 ∩ A_4)$.

:::

Using the same definitions of $A_i$ from
above, $(A'_1 ∩ A_2) ∪ (A_3 ∩ A_4)$ is the event that the first bit
is _not_ distorted _and_ that the second bit _is_ distorted _**or**_
the that the third _and_ fourth bits are distorted, e.g.:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(A′_1 ∩ A_2) ∪ (A_3 ∩ A_4) &= \{ (b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) \in S \\
                           &\quad\quad\quad \mid ( b_1 = n \land b_2 ) = d \lor ( b_3 = b_4 = d ) \} \\
                           &= \begin{aligned}\{
                                & nddd, nddn, ndnd, ndnn, \\
                                & dddd, dndd, nddd, nndd
                              \}\end{aligned} \space_\blacksquare \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Problem 2

> \begin{aligned}
> A &=\{48<X <52\}, \\
> B &=\{9<Y <11\}.
> \end{aligned}
> $$
>
> In a quality audit, 200 parts are inspected. Among them, 170 meet the
> length specification, 150 meet the width specification, and 140 meet
> both specifications.

:::

### part (a)

:::{.question}

> Describe a reasonable sample space for the outcome of $(X, Y)$.

:::

While a naive sample space may be defined with pairs of real numbers
for $X$ & $Y$ (e.g. $\{(X, Y) \forall X \in \real, Y \in \real \}$
), it is easier to think of it in terms of the events $A$ & $B$ above.
This instead gives outcomes composed of pairs of booleans, e.g.:

$$
\begin{aligned}
S &\coloneqq \{ (X, Y) \forall X \in \text{boolean}, Y \in \text{boolean} \} \\
  &= \{ (T, T), (T, F), (F, T), (F, F) \} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (b)

:::{.question}

> Using the information above, complete the following table of counts:

:::

|       | B   | B′  | Total |
| ----- | --- | --- | ----- |
| A     | 140 | 30  | 170   |
| A′    | 10  | 20  | 30    |
| Total | 150 | 50  | 200   |

### part (c)

:::{.question}

> Convert your table in part (b) into a table of probabilities. Using
> this table, compute $P(A), P(B), P(A∩B), P(A′∩B′), P(A∪B)$

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
      P(A) &= \frac{170}{200} = 0.85 \\
      P(B) &= \frac{150}{200} = 0.75 \\
  P(A ∩ B) &= \frac{140}{200} = 0.70 \\
P(A' ∩ B') &= \frac{20}{200} = 0.10 \\
  P(A ∪ B) &= \frac{140 + 10 + 30}{200} = \frac{180}{200} = 0.90 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (d)

:::{.question}

> Use the formula for the probability of a union to compute $P(A ∪ B)$

:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A ∪ B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \\
         &= \frac{140}{200} + \frac{10}{200} + \frac{30}{200} \\
         &= 0.90 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### part (e)

:::{.question}

> Draw a Venn diagram with events $A$ and $B$. Shade the regions corresponding to each of the following events: $A∪B$, $A∩B$, $A∩B′$, $(A∪B)′$.
